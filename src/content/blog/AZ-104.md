## Key Resources for Exam Preparation

### 1. Microsoft Learn
Microsoft Learn is the cornerstone of my preparation. The [AZ-104 learning path](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-104) provides a series of interactive modules, hands-on labs, and assessments that cover all the exam objectives. I recommend:
- Completing each module thoroughly.
- Revisiting challenging topics.
- Using the sandbox environments to practice real-world scenarios.

### 2. Azure Documentation
The [Azure documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/) is an indispensable resource that offers in-depth guidance on every service. Whether you're configuring virtual networks, managing storage, or implementing security policies, the documentation helps clarify complex concepts and best practices.

### 3. Practice Exams
Simulated exams are vital for:
- **Building confidence:** They familiarize you with the exam format and question types.
- **Time management:** Practicing under timed conditions helps develop the skills needed to navigate the actual exam.
  
I used:
- The **official Microsoft practice tests**.
- Additional exams on platforms like **Udemy** and **Whizlabs** to expose myself to a variety of question styles.

### 4. Hands-On Experience
There's no substitute for real-world practice. I dedicated extensive time to:
- **Exploring Azure services:** Using the Azure free tier and sandbox environments helped me deploy and troubleshoot resources.
- **Lab Exercises:** The [AZ-104 Microsoft Azure Administrator repository](https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/AZ-104-MicrosoftAzureAdministrator) on GitHub features practical exercises that reinforce learning through doing.

### 5. Study Tips and Best Practices
- **Master the Fundamentals:** Focus on truly understanding core concepts rather than memorizing steps.
- **Plan Your Study Schedule:** Consistency is key. Break down your study material and set realistic goals.
- **Join Community Forums:** Engage with online communities, study groups, and social media channels to share insights and clarify doubts.
- **Stay Current:** Azure evolves rapidly. Regularly check the Azure blog and update notifications to keep your knowledge fresh.
