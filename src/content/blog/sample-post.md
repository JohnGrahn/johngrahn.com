Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro! Here, I will share my learning journey as I build a new website.

## What I've accomplished âœ¨

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts.
2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.
3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!

## What's next ðŸš€

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.

### Code Example

```typescript
const message: string = "Hello, Astro!";
console.log(message);
```

### Task List
- [x] Create new Astro project
- [x] Set up blog structure
- [ ] Complete Astro tutorial
- [ ] Write more posts
