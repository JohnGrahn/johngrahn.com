## Technical Implementation

This portfolio is built using a powerful combination of modern web technologies:

### Frontend (Astro, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, React)

-   **Astro:** The core framework for building the website. Astro's component-based architecture and focus on performance make it ideal for creating fast, content-driven sites.
-   **Tailwind CSS:** Provides utility-first CSS classes for rapidly styling the site and ensuring a consistent design.
-   **DaisyUI:** A component library built on top of Tailwind CSS, used for pre-designed UI elements like buttons, cards, and navigation bars.
-   **TypeScript:** Adds type safety to the project, improving code quality and reducing errors.
-   **React:** Integrated for interactive elements, like the theme toggle using `useState`.
-   **`src/components/`:** Contains reusable components like `Header.astro`, `Footer.astro`, `ProjectCard.astro`, and `BlogCard.astro`, which structure the site's content and layout.
-   **`src/layouts/`:** Defines layouts for different types of pages, such as `BlogPostLayout.astro` for blog posts and `ProjectLayout.astro` for project details.
-   **`src/pages/`:** Includes the main pages of the site, such as the homepage (`index.astro`), projects page (`projects.astro`), blog (`blog/index.astro`), and resume (`resume.astro`).

### Content Management (Markdown, Content Collections)

-   **Markdown:** Blog posts and project descriptions are written in Markdown, making content creation straightforward and efficient.
-   **Astro Content Collections:**  Provides a structured way to manage content, including validation and automatic TypeScript types for Markdown files.
-   **`src/content/blog/`:** Stores blog posts in Markdown format.
-   **`src/content/projects/`:** Stores project details in Markdown format.
-   **`src/content/resume/`:** Contains the resume content in Markdown.

### Deployment (GitHub Pages, Vercel, Netlify, etc.)

-   **Static Site Generation:** Astro builds the website into static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, making it easy to deploy to various hosting platforms.
-   **GitHub Pages:** The portfolio can be easily hosted on GitHub Pages, leveraging its free and reliable hosting service.
-   **Vercel/Netlify:** Alternative hosting platforms like Vercel or Netlify can also be used for deploying the site, providing features like automatic deployments from a Git repository.
